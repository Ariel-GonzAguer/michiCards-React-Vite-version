# Michi Card (React version)!
## Create Your Own Michi Card Collection! :smiley_cat:

Welcome to this web project, where You can create your very own Kitty Cat Card Collection.\
This project is the same than [MichiCard(html, css, js version)](https://github.com/diosDeNada/michiCards-pure-HTML-CSS-JS-version-) but made it with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)\
With this project You can make cards similar to other card games like Pokemon or Yugi-Oh, but Cat based, to share with your friends via any social media, after take a screenshot.\
The card is only yours :smirk_cat:

### Features
- You can choose all, from the name of the Michi, to the image of your card.
- By the moment are two *'Feral Cards'*, that are singular types of cards. Go for them!
- NEW! Now made it with React. The App works smoother.
- NEW! Navigation improved.


### Device considerations
- :signal_strength: It is essential that the device have an internet connection to use the app.
- :iphone: The app is designed to be used on mobile devices with small-medium to medium-sized screens. On laptops, desktop computers and tablets with large screens, **THE IMAGES COULD LOOK KINDA WEIRD**.
- :arrow_up_down: To avoid image distortion, the device must be placed vertically (not panoramic) when taking the screenshot.
